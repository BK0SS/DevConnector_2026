## 📖 About The Project

DevConnector is a full-stack social network application built for the developer community. It allows users to register, create detailed professional profiles, share posts, and interact with other developers.

This project was originally built as part of the **"MERN Stack Front To Back"** course by Brad Traversy. However, I have significantly refactored the codebase to meet modern development standards.

### 🔧 Key Updates & Legacy Fixes
Because the original course material relies on older dependencies, this repository features a modernized codebase:
* **Updated Dependencies:** Replaced deprecated packages with modern alternatives to ensure security and compatibility.
* **Refactored Code:** Rewrote legacy React patterns to ensure the app runs smoothly in a 2026 environment.
* **Bug Fixes:** Resolved breaking changes caused by updates to Node.js and MongoDB.
